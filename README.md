# Madhav-Ecommerce-Store-Sale---Dashboard

As part of my Power BI learning journey, I created this E-commerce Sales Dashboard for a project inspired by Madhav Store. 🚀
🔍 Key Insights Visualized:
📈 Sales Trends: Monthly profit and performance breakdown.
🗺️ Regional Sales: Focus on state-level contributions like Andhra Pradesh.
💳 Payment Modes: COD leads with 36% share, followed by UPI and EMI.
🛍️ Top Categories & Customers: Clothing dominates quantity, and Shishu stands out as a top customer.
This project helped me explore data modeling, DAX calculations, and dynamic visualizations to turn raw data into actionable insights.
